In traditional Indian geography it falls under the East Indian zone. It is one of the poorest regions in India.<p>
</div>
<div class="content" id="second"><h2>GEOGRAPHY</h2>Bihar is located in the eastern region[4] of India, between latitudes 24°20'10"N and 27°31'15"N and longitudes 83°19'50"E and 88°17'40"E. It is an entirely land–locked state, in a subtropical region of the temperate zone. Bihar lies between the humid West Bengal in the east and the sub humid Uttar Pradesh in the west, which provides it with a transitional position in respect of climate, economy and culture. It is bounded by Nepal in the north and by Jharkhand in the south. Bihar plain is divided into two unequal halves (North Bihar and South Bihar) by the river Ganges[5] which flows through the middle from west to east. Bihar's land has average elevation above sea level of 173 feet.

<br> 
Before 1905, Bihar was a part of British East India Company's Bengal Presidency. In 1905 the Bengal Presidency was divided and created two new provinces: East Bengal and West Bengal. Until then Bihar was part of West Bengal. Again West Bengal and East Bengal reunited in 1911 but the people of Bihar and Orrisa demanded a separate province based on language rather than religion. In 1912 Bihar and Orissa Province was created separating from Bengal Presidency. In 1936, Bihar and Orrisa Province divided into two new provinces: Bihar Province and Orissa Province.<br><br>

<b>Bihar and Orissa Province</b>

Following Divisions were included in Bihar and Orissa Province when it separated from Bengal Presidency in 1912:

<li>Bhagalpur Division (districts of Bhagalpur, Munger (Monghyr), Purnea and the Sonthal Parganas)<br>
<br>
<li>Patna Division (Gaya, Patna and Shahabad)</li>
<br>
<li>Tirhut Division (Champaran, Darbhanga, Muaffarpur and Saran)</li>
<br>
<li>Chota Nagpur Division (Hazaribagh, Manbhum, Palamau, Ranchi and Singhbhum)</li>
<br>
<li>Orissa Division (Angul, Balasore, Cuttack, Puri and Sambatpur)</li>

On 1 April 1936 Bihar and Orissa Province was divided into two new provinces: Bihar Province and Orissa Province
