<h1>Golghar</h1>
The Golghar or Gol Ghar (गोलघर), ("Round House") is a large granary located to the west of the Gandhi Maidan in Patna, capital of Bihar state, India.

<br>
<br>


<b>History</b>
<br>
<br>
According to a contemporary inscription at its base, the Golghar in Patna was intended to be just the first of a series of huge grain stores. In the end, however, no others were ever built. The granary was "part of a general plan … for the perpetual prevention of famine in these provinces".[1]

The beehive - shaped structure was designed by John Garstin of the Bengal Engineers, part of the East India Company's Bengal Army. Its construction was completed on 20 July 1786.

A drive to improve the appearance of the structure was begun in 2002.[2]

<br>
<br>
<b>Architecture</b>
<br>
Built in the Stupa architecture, the building has a height of 29 m. It is pillar-less with a wall of thickness of 3.6 m at the base. One can climb to the top of the Golghar via its 145-step spiral stairway. The spiral staircase was designed to facilitate the passage of the workers who loaded and unloaded the grain in the granary, who had to carry grain-bags up one flight, deliver their load through a hole at the top, and descend the other stairs.

The top of the Golghar presents a panoramic view of the city and the Ganges.

Golghar has never been filled to its maximum capacity and there are no plans to do so. Some have claimed that the reason for this is a flaw whereby the doors are designed to open inwards; thus, if it is filled to its maximum capacity, then the doors will not open.[3] However, visitors have found that the doors open outwards.[1] Presently renovation of this historical monument is underway.

<h2>Gandhi Ghat</h2>
<br>

Gandhi Ghat is perhaps the most well-developed and tourist friendly bank of the Ganga in Bihar.

It might come as a surprise to visitors that although the riverfront in Patna stretches for 11 miles, it is not as developed or integral to the city as say, in Varanasi or Haridwar. While earlier many notable monuments – such as the palace of Darbhanga Maharaj, Quila House, Sher Shah Suri’s fort and Tekari House – were built along the ghats (river bank), the riverfront is quite scenic and beautiful. The Ganga is especially majestic during the monsoons, when a torrential flow and cool winds serenade the banks. Of all the banks, Gandhi Ghat, located behind the National Institute of Technology (NIT), is the most prominent and tourist friendly. To reach the ghat, take shared autos from Gandhi Maidan towards Patna City and get off after Science College. There is a plaza at the ghat with shaded benches, food stalls and a riverside restaurant, Bhagirathi Vihar. It also has facilities for boating, including the official MV Ganga Vihar, a cruise ship.

In a bid to boost ‘spiritual tourism’, the Bihar government organizes an aarti (a Hindu worship ritual) at the Gandhi Ghat every Saturday and Sunday. Started on the lines of the aarti in Haridwar and Varanasi (where priests from Patna were sent for training in conducting aartis), the ritual is an enthralling spectacle where priests perform synchronized movements with lit lamps and smoky incense to the rhythm of chants and hymns.
Gandhi Ghat is also the gateway to Ganga Diara (river island), one of the many river islands along the banks of Patna.
