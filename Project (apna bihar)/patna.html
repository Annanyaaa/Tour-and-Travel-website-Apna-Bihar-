<b><p>The capital of Bihar, Patna is the second largest metropolis in eastern India.</p></b>
<br>
<br>
<b>Patna</b>
<br>

<ol>
It was home to many scholars of ancient India – think Aryabhatta, Chanakya and Panini. The city was also the capital of the mighty Magadha Empire and at the epicenter of two of the largest religions in India – Buddhism and Jainism – and an important destination for Sikhism, another major religion in the country
With a history of over two millennia, Patna’s origins can be traced to the Magadha King, Ajatshatru, who built a small fort in Pataligram on the banks of the the Ganga river in the 6th century BC. Standing on the confluence of three rivers, the Ganga, the Sone and the Poonpun, the city is of importance to both the Hindus and the Sikhs.
After the city was taken over by the British in the 17th century, it became an international trade center and several buildings including the Patna Museum were constructed in the Indo-Saracenic style of architecture. The museum houses about 50,000 rare art objects dating back to ancient, middle ages and British colonial eras. The Holy Relic Casket that holds the sacred ashes of Lord Buddha and the Yakshani statue are the highlights of the museum.
The tenth Sikh Guru, Guru Gobind Singh was born in Patna in 1660 and the Har Mandir Takht was built at the place of his birth.
